````

Or manually install key packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn jupyter
```

## 🧪 How to Use

### ▶️ Run Notebooks

Use Jupyter Notebooks for interactive visualization:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Explore each file like `Canny.ipynb`, `K-Means-Segmentation.ipynb`, etc., for specific techniques.

### ▶️ Run Python Scripts

Scripts like `k_means_segmentation.py` and `meanshiftsegmentation.py` can be run as:

```bash
python k_means_segmentation.py
```

Ensure the input image path is correct within the script.
